\newpage 
Problem 1. (a) Negate the following statement:
\[
\forall \text{ graph } G \text{, If } |V(G)| = n \text{ then } |E(G)| \ge n.
\]

\vspace{1in} 

(b) Give a counterexample to show the above statement is false (i.e. the negation that you just wrote is true).

\vspace{2.5in}

Problem 2. Use DeMorgan's laws to prove or disprove the following:
\[
(p\wedge q)\rightarrow r \equiv \sim r \rightarrow (p\rightarrow \sim q) \equiv (q\wedge \sim r) \rightarrow \sim p
\]


\newpage

Problem 3. Prove the following statement:\\
``For every composite integer $n$ the integer $2^n -1 $ is also composite."

\vspace{.5in}
Hint: Remember your difference of squares $a^2-b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$.\\
And remember the geometric sum $\frac{x^{n+1}-1}{x-1} = 1 + x + x^2 + \dots + x^n$.

\newpage

Problem 4. Draw three graphs: The first with an Euler(ian), but not a Hamilton(ian) circuit.  The second with a Hamilton(ian) circuit, but not an Euler(ian) circuit. The third graph should a tree with with 6 vertices and 3 termincal vertices.

\newpage

Problem 5. This graph is called the ``Petersen graph." It is important for many reasons.

(a) Write down its adjacency matrix.

(b) Does this path have a Hamiltonian or Euler(ian) circuit?

\newpage

Problem 6.  Is it possible for a simple undirected graph with $n$ vertices to have every vertex with a unique degree? This is equivalent to asking whether it is possible to have a party in which no two people know the same number of people.

\newpage 

Problem 7.  Let $ A= \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}$ 
(a) Find $A^2$, $A^3$.\\

(b) Let $G$ be a graph with three vertices and adjacency matrix $A$.  Draw $G$.\\

(c) Find $(A^3)_{3,3}$ Label the walks on your graph which match this.

\newpage

Problem 8.  In the set $A = \{1000,1001,\dots,9999 \}$ how many numbers are multiples of $7,17,$ or $37$? (Mathematical ``or")\\

Hint: Let $S_n$ be the subset of $A$ of multiples of $n$.\\

What is $N(S_7 \cup S_{17}\cup S_{37})$?


\newpage

Problem 9. Suppose we flip 11 ``fair" coins.\\
(a) What is the probability of getting exactly 5 ``heads?"\\
(b) What is the probability of getting exactly 3 ``heads" or exactly 8 ``heads?"

\vspace{2.5in}


Problem 10. Is it possible to have a graph of 5 vertices with the vertex degrees $2,2,3,3,3?$ If so, draw this graph.  If not explain why not.

\newpage

Bonus. An $n$ dimensional hypercube is defined as the set of points $(\pm \frac{1}{2},\pm \frac{1}{2},\dots,\pm \frac{1}{2})$.

A square for example is the four point set 
\[
(1/2,1/2),(1/2,-1/2),(-1/2,1/2),(-1/2,-1/2)
\]

The cube has eight points, the 4-hypercube 16, etc...
How many edges and vertices are in the $n$ hypercube graph?
